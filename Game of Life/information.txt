This project was implementing Conway's Game of Life cellular automation game. There is a lot of code here, and looking through it, I have written everything under the comments "//write me" They were laid out in our instructions, but essentially we were given the barebones of the game and we had to do all of the checks for cells to multiply, update all of the cells on the screen etc.
