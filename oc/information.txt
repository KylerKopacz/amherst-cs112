So I believe for this project, I was asked to implement a data structure that implemented the OrderedCollection interface. This was the part of the class where we were learning about:
	Interfaces:
		What they are
		How to use them
	
	User-Defined Classes:
		How to write them
	Generics:
		What they were
		Why is would be good to make classes that use them

So I believe that I wrote all of the MyGenericDS. This was to get an idea of why using generics would be beneficial (being able to reuse code for different types of data). We were also asked to crack the code written by Pro Haxor (an imaginary hacker that made many appearances throughout the semester)
