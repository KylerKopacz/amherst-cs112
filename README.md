# amherst-cs112
This repo contains all of the code that was written for the COSC-112 class at Amherst College. I have tried to break all of the code into assignments, and I am also in the process of adding an information.txt file to all of the assignments to clarify what I have written, and what was given to me to start. 

Please note that all of the assignments for the class has closed, so I cannot specify what files are supposed to be used with others. However, I will do my best to recall all of the things that I have done to the best of my ability.
