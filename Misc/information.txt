This folder was the rest of the labs that did not have multiple files. In MonteCarlo.java, we had to write a program that estimated the area of circles using Monte Carlo estimation. The I had to write the estimate method, which threw "darts" and calculated the ratio of darts thrown and landed in the circle to the amount thrown total. The more darts that were thrown, the greater you can estimate the area of the circle. 

For skyline.java, we were asked to create a random skyline that would be drawn every time the program was run. We also had to create a random patch of stars that were in the sky. I wrote all of Skyline.java
